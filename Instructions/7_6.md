7.6 "Delete" menu option
You will implement the delete_item() function. Read the docstring provided for the function and the assert statements provided carefully to understand what the function should do.

def delete_item(in_list, idx, start_idx = 0):
    """
    param: in_list - a list from which to remove an item
    param: idx (str) - a string that is expected to
            contain a representation of an integer index
            of an item in the provided list
    param: start_idx (int) - by default, set to 0;
            an expected starting value for idx that
            gets subtracted from idx for 0-based indexing

    The function first checks if the input list is empty.
    The function then calls is_valid_index() to verify
    that the provided index idx is a valid positive
    index that can access an element from info_list.
    On success, the function saves the item from info_list
    and returns it after it is deleted from in_list.

    returns:
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    If idx is not of type string or start_idx is not an int, return None.
    If is_valid_index() returns False, return -1.
    Otherwise, on success, the function returns the element
    that was just removed from the input list.

    Helper functions:
    - is_valid_index()
    """
The assert statements for this function are as follows:

assert delete_item([], 1, 1) == 0
assert delete_item([1], '-2') == -1
assert delete_item([1, 2, 3], '2') == 3
Your next task is to figure out how to assemble the main program portion for correctly deleting an item.

Below are the various interactions with the user using some sample tasks on the list (note the similarities with the "Update" option).

note that ellipses hide the menu and some sample tasks on the list - they are NOT part of the program
Deleting all tasks:

Only the upper-case M gets us back to the main menu (this is implemented in the main program but is similar to how it's done in get_selection()):
